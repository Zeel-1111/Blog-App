        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <li>I, Zeel Thakkar, am a student at L. D. College of Engineering - passing year 2024.</li>
        <li>During the development of this website, I learnt setting the routes in Node.js using Express.</li>
        <li>I also learnt to use MongoDB Atlas and mongoose to connect the application to database.</li>
        <li>Also I have developed the application based on MVC architecture, seperating the model(to connect the application to the database ane also specify its schema), controller(to interact with the database from the application) and view(ejs view engine) of the  application for enhanced code readability and modularity.</li>
